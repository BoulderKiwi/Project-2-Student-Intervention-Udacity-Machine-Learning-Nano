### P2 - Student-Intervention

I tested several classification algorithims to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate based on the data provided. By training data on students that passed or not, the model will be able to predict which students will pass or not pass, allowing administrators the ability to identify candidates for early intervention before they actually fail.
