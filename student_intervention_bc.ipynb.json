    "Since the goal is to identify students who might need early intervention, our predictor variable is discrete—the “pass\" variable. By training data on students that passed or not, the model will be able to predict which students will pass or not pass, allowing administrators the ability to identify candidates for early intervention before they actually fail. Various classification algorithms will be trained with cross validation to compare the predictive accuracy of the classifiers. With the decision boundary identified, we can predict the class label for new data. Furthermore, regression would not be appropriate for this problem because the response variable is continuous, and will is not suitable for classifying students by the discrete class variable “pass.” \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "In an Efficient Multi-Relational Naïve Bayesian Classifier based on Semantic Relationship Graph, Liu argues that multi-relational Naïve Bayesian classifiers work well at predicting a borrower’s ability to repay loans. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms predict borrower’s default risk by merging social network data with traditional credit data; however, when social network data is merged from several sources into one data table, the single data table suffers from high redundancy. Bayesian classification methods can handle high redundancy, which is why Naïve Bayes classifiers are used in the P2P lending industry. \n",
    "The Naïve Bayes classifier has several strengths: it is easy to implement, well known and understood, and empirically successful. If independence of attributes holds, NB classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models thus requiring less training data. \n",
    "Naïve Bayes biggest disadvantage is its simplicity. At times, model complexity is advantageous when generalizing the relationship of from complex relationships and interactions. Furthermore, the assumption of independence among attributes may not be realistic and models that do not force this assumption on the class structure can better perform when there is high dependence among attributes. According to Haste, even if the individual class density estimates are biased, the posterior probabilities near the decision can withstand considerable bias—the posterior probabilities smooth can be smooth even if the population class densities are not (pg. 210-211).\n",
    "Naïve Bayes was a good candidate because it the data set was small, thus a more complex classifier may over fit compared to Naïve Bayes. According to a Udacity lecturer, Naïve Bayes is a good first model that can provide a reasonable baseline to compare other models against. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Bergstra, AdaBoost methods have been proven adept within the music streaming industry to classify digital music.  Given a set of audio features that have been extracted from segments of songs, the AdaBoost classifier can be trained to predict both the musical genre and artist. Interestingly, the authors provide evidence that AdaBoost classification works better if the classifier is trained on only segments of audio, not entire songs or individual sort-timescale features. By accurately classifying a listener’s taste in music, digital streaming services can provide more accurate suggestions (Apple’s Genius) to customers seeking new artists. \n",
    "The AdaBoost classifier has several strengths: it is computationally efficient, the parameters are easy to set, and crucially, a wide array of weak learners may be used including, the AdaBoost, Bernoulli NB, DecisionTree, Multinomial N.B., NuSVC, Perceptron, Random Forest, Ridge Classifier and Support Vector Machines. \n",
    "The AdaBoost classifier has several weaknesses: it is susceptible to uniform noise, the base learners should be weak learners in order to avoid overfitting and a sufficient amount of data is necessary utilize weak learner’s ability to make use of marginal improvements that in aggregate provide complexity. \n",
    "AdaBoost classifier was a good candidate because Boosting can create complex classifiers through weak learners—thus allowing AdaBoost to iteratively focus on the data points that are more difficult to classify.  \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kaiyi, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier has been used in New Zealand to automate the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) to improve food safety. To implement the first and second principles of the HACCP, the SVM classifies hazards into critical control points (CCPs) and non-CCPs. SVM have shown considerable advantages in this complex structured task of food safety. \n",
    "The SVM classifier has multiple strengths: it is effective in high dimensional spaces and in cases where the number of dimension is greater than the number of samples, it is memory efficient because it concentrates on a subset of training points near the decision boundary (support vectors) rather than all the data points. \n",
    "The SVM classifier has several disadvantages: given a large data set, the SVM performs requires a longer training time, noisy data (overlapping target classes) can cause SVM to perform worse than Naïve Bayes classifiers and given a lot of features, it will perform slowly and tend to over fit the data. \n",
    "The SVM classifier was a good candidate because SVM do well with complicated domains with marginal separations at the decision boundary—since we are trying to maximize the margin with SVMs.  Additionally, since the data was not very large or feature rich, SVM classifier was a good candidate. \n",

The size of the data available was quite small—only 395 data points.  SVMs are known to perform well on small data sets. The SVM classifier steadily improved the F1 score, a weighted average of the precision and recall tested, when given more training samples. This is encouraging because we can likely improve the F1 score further if we collect and train the data on a larger data set. The resource required (time) to train the model was much lower for the SVM than the AdaBoost classifier—giving SVM an advantage over the AdaBoost classifier even though the F1 scores were about the same. Although the Gaussian NB classifier required even less time than the SCM classifier, it fell short in terms of F1 score. \n",

The “pass” variable is what we would like to predict (output variable = response), while all the other variables are used to make those predictions (input variables = features.) We devise a way to place students on the basketball court so that students with the most similar features are grouped closest to one another. Then, based on the response variable, we give students who passed a green shirt and those that failed a red shirt. Our goal is take a rope and pass it between students on the basketball court to separate them by shirt color—maximizing the distance between the rope and students closest to the rope (the margin.)  \n",

    "   If the original data of students is representative of the population, the rope will allow us to place new students on the basketball court based on the same features. Once we look at where the students are standing, we can predict who will pass or fail based on what side of the rope they are on. The SVM works much the same way, implementing what is known as the kernel-trick to allow the rope to curve between students. The SVM will implement cross-validation, which is a fancy way to avoid overfitting by holding back some students (testing set) that will be used to evaluate how well the model classifies students (training set). We will randomly subset the students up into 10 smaller groups and allow each group to be the testing set for the 9 other groups in order to aggregate the 9 different ropes that are made to avoid overfitting. \n",
